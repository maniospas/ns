        <h1>The NS framework</h1>
        <p>Behind NSLang, which is a programming language, lies a metaprogramming framework called NS. This treats scopes, code blocks, and objects interchangeably; you can use the same simple interfaces to create complex designs, custom expressions, and self-modifying code.</p> 
		
		<p> NS is not a language by itself (it's not Turing complete) but it lets you define expressions that map to precompiled C++ code. Thus, it simplifies development of fully-fleshed programming languages, and even compiled scopes that you can share between languages. At first, only the core framework is described, but later NSLang will be presented as a minimal augmentation of NS that is a complete language.
		</p>
        <section id="assignment-scope">
          <h4>Assignment scope</h4>
		  <p>In NS, scopes are blocks of code with clearly defined rules regarding which variables or expressionsÂ they can access. Expressions are custom programming commands, some of them programmatically defined (you can make expressions look like methods, but can also create other structures that comprise multiple predicates). Declaring runable expressions is done with the := operation. Use = to assign specific values to variables. These two assignment operators and the scope access : described later have the highest priority after scope brackets, and the leftmost one is prioritized. Before formally introducing expressions, only variable assignment will be used.</p>
		
		  <p>Starting from a top-level scope, you can declare new scopes inside it, separated by semicolons. Scopes can be enclosed within brackets or parentheses. Parentheses can be omitted, in which case NS dynamically tries to recognize the would-be scopes (it only creates an error in case of ambiguity). Bracketed scopes do not modify external variables unless they explicitly access them via objects. Here's an example:
		  </p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">x = 0;
{ // does not modify the superscope
	x = 1;
	print(x); //1
};
print(x); //0
( // keeps reading and writing from the same scope
	x = 1;
	print(x); //1
);
print(x); //1</code></pre>
        
		<p>The last expression of scopes doesn't require a semicolon if you don't want to add it. It also serves as a returned value. Prefer bracketed scopes for safe assignment, but parentheses scopes have lower execution time overhead.</p>
		
<pre><code class="language-cpp">y = {
	x = 1;
	x
};
print(y); //1</code></pre>
		
        </section>
		
		
		

        <section id="scopes-as-objects">
          <h4>Scopes as objects</h4>
          <p>NS treats scopes as objects that hold their assigned variables. This view is stored in the <tag class="fst-italic">new</tag> variable. At the surface level, think of this as an object storing all values declared in the scope, though it can also be used to re-enter the scope (more later). After obtaining the <tag class="fst-italic">new</tag> of a scope, you can access object fields using the scope access : operator.  Here's an example of using new to effectively create an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">point = {
	x = 1;
	y = 2;
	new
};
print(point:x); //1 (runs the expression x in the point scope without NSLang)
print(point:y); //1</code></pre>
		
		<p>All scopes have some additional variables that may modify their behavior (<tag class="fst-italic">super</tag>, <tag class="fst-italic">new</tag>, <tag class="fst-italic">ext</tag>). Of these, <tag class="fst-italic">super</tag> refers to the superscope, which is one level higher in the scope declaration hierarchy. When a variable or expression is not found in a scope, it's retrieved from the superscope. <tag class="fst-italic">new</tag> holds the scope's assignments as a map/object and can be returned. We will talk about <tag class="fst-italic">ext</tag> later. Here's an example of using the superscope's variables inside a scope:</p>
		
<pre><code class="language-cpp">z = 1;
y = 3;
point = {
	x = z;
	y = y+1; (sets the scope's y as super:y+1)
	new
};
z = 0;
print(z); //0
print(point:x); //1
print(point:super:z); //0
print(y); //3 (did not change due to bracket)
print(point:y); //4</code></pre>
        </section>
        
		
        <section id="define-expressions">
          <h4>Define expressions</h4>
          <p>NS supports expressions, which are combinations of predicates that define callable formulas. Expresions can specify various notations that include spaces and can have any number of positional arguments. Arguments are enclosed in parentheses, and the comma is treated as a shorthand for <tag class="fst-italic">)(</tag>. Use the := assignment operator to declare how expressions should run. For instance, you can define an object constructor like this:<p> 

<pre><code class="language-cpp">Point(x,y,z) := { // x, y, z automatically accessed from super
    new
};
point = Point(1,2,3);
print(point.x); //1
print(point.y); //2
print(point.z); //3
</code></pre>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
			Variables are expressions without arguments that always output the same value. They are different in that they can not be overloaded (rewritting their value makes any previous value irretrievable).
		</div>

		<p>Following scope assignment rules, expression implementations can be enclosed in parentheses to transfer their internal assignments to the scope they are called from. For example, this can let formulas modify the scope they are retrieved from:

<pre><code class="language-cpp">Point(x,y,z) := {
    norm squared:=x*x + y*y + z*z; 
    shrink(a) := (x=x*a;y=y*a;z=z*a;); //to keep track of the last argument value within Point, also set a=a
    new
};
A = Point(0,0,1);
print(A:norm squared); //1
</code></pre>


		<p>Polymorphism of expressions can be achieved by declaring new methods with different numbers of arguments. NS also generalizes type polymorphism by allowing logical checks that can be computed on arguments after entering their scope with the : notation (see below for scope entering). For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">Point(x,y,z) := {norm squared:=x*x+y*y+z*z;new};
Point(x,y) := Point(x,y,0);
Point(x:new<0,y) := Point(0,y);
A = Point(1,1);
print(A:norm squared); //2
A = Point(-1,1);
print(A:norm squared); //1
</code></pre>
	<p>Use objects to pass keyword arguments or arguments that you donât want to remain in the objectâs scope.</p>
        </section>
        
		
        <section id="scope-access">
          <h4>Scope access</h4>
          
		<p>You can interact with and manipulate scopes after their creation by entering them with the operator : to continue running operation inside. By writting a:b, you run the scope b within the scope/object a. Here's an example of accessing a scope:</p>
		
<pre><code class="language-cpp">point = {
	x=1;
	y=2;
	new
};
point:x = 5; // the same as point:(x=5);
print(point:x); //5

point:(x=1; y=1;);
print(point:x); //1
print(point:y); //1

derived = point:{y=6;new}; //super of derived is the point
print(derived:x); //1
print(derived:y); //6
print(derived:super:x); //1</code></pre>
		
		<p>In the above scenarios, only variables of the accessed scope were manipulated. However, you will typically
		want to pass some information from the scope from which the entry happened. This last scope
		is temporarily stored in the <tag class="fst-italic">ext</tag> variable. Use this variable to pass messages between scopes.
		Its value is not retained after exiting the scope, 
		so keep a reference to it if you do not want to lose it.
		Here's an example of using <tag class="fst-italic">ext</tag> to transfer information from an external scope:</p>
		
<pre><code class="language-cpp">x = 1;
a = {
	x = 0;
	new
};
print(a:x); //0
a:x=ext:x+1; //equivalent to a:(x=(ext:x+1)) because leftmost operators are given priority
print(a:x); //1
</code></pre>

	<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
		The expression a:x = x first accesses the scope and then performs x=x. You would need to write a:x=ext:x to retrieve an external variable.
	</div>
		
	<p>Below is a more complicated example that overrides an expression using the : operation, in which a <tag class="fst-italic">base</tag> scope keeps track of the superscope and is used to define a new version of the inequality formula in the scope <tag class="fst-italic">stricter</tag> by fallbacking to the base during its implementation.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">stricter = {
    base = super; // super will change when entering brackets
    (x)<(y) := {
        base: (#x < #y-1) //computation under the base scope
    };
    new
};
a = 1;
b = 2;
comp = stricter:(ext:a)<(ext:b); //test a comparison under the new scope
print(comp)
</code></pre>

      <section id="nslang">
        <h1>NSLang</h1>
        <p>NSLang is an extension of NS that includes the necessary epxressions to form a functional programming language. To include it in your scope, <a href="https://github.com/maniospas/ns">download</a> the namesake directory from the project's page, place it next to your <tag class="fst-italic">ns</tag> executable, and run the following file from within your code:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-cpp">run('nslang/all.ns');
</code></pre>

		<p>This loads all language expressions, including control flow (conditions and loops). Inside the <tag class="fst-italic">nslang</tag> directory, you can also find implementations of independent scopes, some of which you can reuse to define new programming languages, or to load lightweight subsets of NSLang.</p>
		
        <section id="math">
          <h4>Math</h4>
          <p>NS already parses numbers into numberic values, but does not perform any specific operation on them. Such operations are provided by NSLang. First of all, base arithmetic operations +-*/ are provided, as well as the power operation **. Additional expressions you can use are exp(x), log(x), log(base,x).</p>

        </section>
		
		
        <section id="io">
          <h4>I/O</h4>
          <p>Two base operations are provided for command line inputs and outputs: print and read. The first prints any kind of value, whereas the second reads a string from the console while displaying a message. Use them as in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">name = read("Please give your name: ");
print("Hello "+name+"!");
</code></pre>
        </section>
        
        <section id="control-flow">
          <h4>Control flow</h4>
          <p>NS provides conditions and loops. When useing these, remember that that assignments within bracketed scopes do not escape to parents, even if you put these in the body of the flows. However, conditions are also scopes to be evaluated</p> 
		  <p>For example, the following snippet prints the squares of all integers less than 10 without exposing any internally generated variables; the loop's condition is responsible for iterating through the integeres by changing the superscope's iterated variable, and the body performs safe assignments.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">i=-1;
while(i=i+1;i<10) {
	i squared = i*i;
	print(i squared);
}
</code></pre>

		<p>You can write consise loops by creating a scope object with initial values and entering this to run the loop. For example, the following snippet computes the sum 1+2+...+10 without leaking any values to the surrounding scope. Notice how the initializer scope is bracketed for safety, but the loop's body edits the variable x and thus it is not. The outcome of entering the initializer scope is the last output of the loop.
		</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">sum = {i=0;x=0;new}:while(i=i+1;i<=10) (x=x+i);
print(sum); // 55
</code></pre>

        <section id="errors">
          <h4>Errors</h4>
          <p>Syntax and logical errors are caught with a try command; this takes a scope as an argument and ruturns either its outcome or the error. To run code that prevents side effects on non-objects, enclose error-prone code in brackets like this;
<pre><code class="language-cpp">error = try {
	x = 1;
	y = x + z;//non-existing variable z
};
print(error);
</code></pre> 
		  
		  The following snippet implements NSLang's command line interface. Notice that error catching is applied on each running command to ensure execution safety.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">run('nslang/all.ns');
cli = 1;
exit := (cli = 0;'NS command line terminated.');
output = ( //keep scope modifications with parentheses

      <section id="high-order-features">
        <h1>High Order Features</h1>
        <p>NS offers advanced features like runtime parsing and metaprogramming. Runtime parsing involves tokenizing and parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree. Metaprogramming allows you to work with unevaluated scopes and define lambda expressions.</p>
		
        <section id="runtime-parsing">
          <h4>Runtime parsing</h4>
          <p>Before looking at more complex features, you need to understand how NS performs internal computations;
		  source code in textual form is tokenized (e.g., 'while(i<10)' is split to tokens 'while' '(' 'i' '<' '10')) and parsed into an abstract syntax tree of <b>only core features</b>. This is analogous to a compilation process, with the difference that it does not provide bytecode but an internal representation. To account for expressions, which can be dynamically defined and depend on the scope, unparsed expressions are retained as they are.</p>
		  
		  <p>Scope definitions using parentheses or brackets of the unparsable expressions may have been correctly parsed and reside alongside the yet-uncomplied tokens. Tokenization is finalized and does not need to rerun, but it is yet unclear how the expression should be interpreted, as it may comprise nested expressions. For example, 1+2*3 can not be immediately parsed, because the meaning of * and + needs to be extracted from the scope running the expression in the end.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>Unparsed expression are parsed at the first point where their values is retrieved, and to make complex code run fastly the outcome of parsing is retained for future use.</p>
        </section>
		
		
        <section id="expression-overloading">
          <h4>Expression overloading</h4>
          <p>NS supports expressions with the same syntax that compute differently for different arguments. 
		  Doing this is done with a fallback into each argument's scope (this has as supperscope the expression's calling scope). For the arguments this is applied, the fallback should compute to either true (1) or false (0), given whether an argument being checked is accepted or not. The following example shows how to declare different implementations. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
		  Complex(re,im):= {class='complex'; new};
		  (a:try class is 'complex') + (b:try class is 'complex') := Complex(a.re+b.re, a.im+b.im);
		  (a:try class is 'complex') - (b:try class is 'complex') := Complex(a.re-b.re, a.im-b.im);
		  (a:try class is 'complex') * (b:try class is 'complex') := Complex((a.re*b.re)-(a.im*b.im), (a.re*b.im)+(a.im*b.re));
</code></pre>
	
        </section>
		
		
        <section id="metaprogramming">
			<h4>Metaprogramming</h4>
			<p>Metaprogramming refers to the ability of a program to manipulate and generate code dynamically. In NS, metaprogramming is achieved by passing unevaluated scopes as expression arguments. Unevaluated scopes are essentially blocks of code that are not executed immediately, but can be evaluated later when needed. You can think of them as code templates. Declare that an expression argument should remain unevaluated by using double parenthesis. To execute an unevaluated scope pass it as an agrument to the run function. Here is an example:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">sequence((first))((second)) := (
	print("first");
	run(first);
	print("second");
	run(second)
);

sequence(x=1;print(" ...done"), x=2;print(" ...done")); //don't forget that , is parsed as )(
</code></pre>	


		<p>Unevaluated scopes can be returned with lambda expressions, which you can define like in the following example:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-cpp">lambda((code)) := {core}; //just return the unevaluated scope given as input
condition tight = lambda(x<10); // does not run immediately
condition loose = lambda(x<100); // does not run immediately
magnitude(x, condition) := {
	if(run(condition)) {  // or if(condition) as the latter already evaluates conditions
		print("small");
	}
	else {
		print("large");
	}
};
magnitude(20, condition tight);
magnitude(20, condition loose);
</code></pre>


		
        <section id="functional-programming">
			<h4>Functional programming</h4>
		<p>Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, and avoids changing state and mutable data. While NS doesn't have traditional functions, it generalizes the same principles to expressions by letting them enclose appropriate methods to be called. For example:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-cpp">condition tight = {call(x):={x<10};new}; // create functional types with different method names
condition loose = {call(x):={x<100};new};
magnitude(value, condition) := {
	if(condition:call value) {  // failback (:) avoids using any x from magnitude in the condition 
		print("small");
	}
	else {
		print("large");
	};
};
magnitude(x,condition) := {print(condition);if(condition: call x) {print("small");}else{print("large");};};
magnitude(20, condition tight);  // small
magnitude(20, condition loose);  // large

      <section id="new-scope-files">
        <h1>New scope files (aka libraries)</h1>
        <p>You can set the outcome of <a href="#running-files">running a file</a> to a variable. Files run in their parent scope, which means that you need to either gain all their declarations with a simple run or obtain their declaration from a bracket scope. To support this, return new at the end of runnable files. Consider the scope file utils.ns with contents:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-cpp">sqr(x) := x*x;
pi = 3.14159;
new
</code></pre>	
		
		<p>To avoid compromising declaration safety, obtain the file's expression with brackets, like this:</p>

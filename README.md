# Download (windows)
Download the interpreter executable `ns.exe` and add it to your path. 
Run a source code file `file.ns` with the following command line instruction.

```
ns file.ns
```

If you do not provide a file or run the interpreter by double-clicking it, 
`cli.ns` will be interpreted (download it alongside the executable). 
This is a command line interface for NS.
